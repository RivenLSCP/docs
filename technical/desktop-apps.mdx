## Overview

We provide cross-platform desktop applications that serve as a powerful GUI client for managing AI data assets referenced on the SUI blockchain and stored off-chain in Walrus. These native applications allow you to:

- Browse and manage datasets and models recorded on SUI
- Seamlessly fetch or push data to/from Walrus
- Trigger off-chain workflows, model deployments, and inference tasks
- Monitor performance, logs, and resource usage
- Configure on-chain and off-chain settings from a unified interface

## Installation

### Download & Setup

<Steps>
  1. **Download**
     Get the appropriate version for your OS from [downloads.sera.xyz](https://downloads.sera.xyz)

  2. **Verify**
     Check the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded file to ensure integrity.

  3. **Install**
     Follow OS-specific installation steps. Make sure your SUI CLI or wallet is installed and accessible.

  4. **First Run**
     On first launch, the app may prompt you to connect your SUI wallet or provide private keys. Complete initial setup, off-chain Walrus gateway configuration, and authentication.
</Steps>

## Features

### Data Management

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Dataset Tools" icon="database">
    - • Visual exploration of datasets stored off-chain in Walrus 
    - • On-chain metadata inspection (category, schema, versions)
    - • Quality analysis aided by off-chain verification tools
    - • Format conversion steps performed locally or triggered off-chain
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Management" icon="brain">

    - • Local staging of model weights from Walrus
    - • Deploy or trigger off-chain inference tasks
    - • Version control and performance monitoring with on-chain audit records
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Vector Database Interface
The desktop app provides a GUI for interacting with off-chain vector databases (ChromaDB) referenced on-chain:

```python
# Desktop app provides GUI for these operations
from sera.desktop import VectorDBManager

manager = VectorDBManager()
# Connect using on-chain references
manager.connect_to_collection("my_collection") 

# Build queries visually and run them off-chain
query = manager.build_query(
    dimensions=768,
    filters={"category": "tech"}
)
results = manager.run_query(query)
```

### Monitoring Dashboard

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/desktop-dashboard.png" alt="Desktop Dashboard" />
</Frame>
The dashboard displays off-chain metrics (like CPU, GPU usage) and on-chain references to performance baselines, all in one place.

## Configuration

### Settings Management

Manage both on-chain and off-chain settings through the desktop application’s unified config interface. Off-chain settings (like memory and GPU usage) are stored locally; on-chain policies (like access rights, version locks) must be confirmed via your SUI wallet or CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="General Settings">
    ```yaml
    app:
      theme: "dark"
      language: "en"
      updates: "automatic"
      telemetry: false
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance Settings">
    ```yaml
    performance:
      cache_size: "2GB"
      max_memory: "8GB"
      threads: 4
      gpu_enabled: true
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Resource Management

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Memory Settings" icon="memory">
    - • Configure local caching for quick dataset/model access
    - • Set memory limits to prevent system overload
    - • Manage local swap or ephemeral storage
  </Card>
  <Card title="GPU Settings" icon="microchip">
    - • Select which GPU to use if multiple are available
    - • Tune memory allocation for model inference tasks off-chain
    - • Manage power states and performance modes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Integration

### API Access

The desktop app can communicate with local or remote off-chain APIs. SUI interactions are done through local CLI or integrated wallets, while Walrus and vector DB operations use off-chain endpoints.

```python
from sera.desktop import DesktopClient

client = DesktopClient()

# Manage datasets: import a local dataset, then reference it on-chain
dataset = client.import_dataset(
    path="./local_dataset",
    name="my_dataset",
    description="Local dataset import"
)

# Deploy model off-chain, record references on-chain
deployment = client.deploy_model(
    model_path="./local_model",
    resources={
        "gpu": 1,
        "memory": "4GB"
    }
)
```

### Automation

You can set up workflows that run periodically or on triggers. Off-chain pipelines can be defined in the desktop app, and completion events are recorded on SUI.

```python
from sera.desktop.automation import Workflow

# Create automated workflow
workflow = Workflow("data_processing")
workflow.add_step("import_data", source="./data")
workflow.add_step("preprocess", config={"format": "parquet"})
workflow.add_step("upload", destination="sera://datasets")

# Schedule workflow
workflow.schedule(
    cron="0 0 * * *",  # Daily at midnight
    notify=True
)
```

## Security

### Authentication

<Steps>
  1. **Initial Setup**
     Configure your SUI wallet or CLI for signing on-chain transactions. Store Walrus API keys securely in encrypted local storage.

  2. **Key Management**
     Manage private keys off-chain. The desktop app never stores keys on-chain.

  3. **Session Control**
     Track active sessions and requests, require re-authentication when needed.

  4. **Audit Logging**
     Off-chain logs can be hashed and references stored on SUI for auditability.
</Steps>

### Data Protection

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Local Storage" icon="hard-drive">
    - • Encrypted local caches of model weights and datasets
    - • Secure keyrings or OS-provided secure enclaves for API keys
    - • Data cleanup tools to purge sensitive info
  </Card>
  <Card title="Network Security" icon="shield">
    - • TLS encryption for connections to Walrus gateways and remote APIs 
    - • Certificate validation
    - • Proxy and firewall integration for secure network paths
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Installation Issues">
    - Ensure SUI CLI/wallet is installed and accessible
    - Check disk space and system dependencie
    - Run installer with admin privileges if needed
    - Clear temporary installer files
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance Issues">
    - Monitor resource usage via the dashboard
    - Clear caches if experiencing slowdowns
    - Update GPU drivers for better performance
    - Check network stability for Walrus or off-chain compute access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Logs & Diagnostics

```bash
# Windows
%APPDATA%\Sera\logs\

# macOS
~/Library/Logs/Sera/

# Linux
~/.config/Sera/logs/
```
Share logs with support for troubleshooting, and consider hashing logs and storing references on SUI for secure auditing.

## Updates & Maintenance

### Auto Updates

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Update Settings" icon="arrows-rotate">
    ```yaml
    updates:
      channel: "stable"
      automatic: true
      schedule: "daily"
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Version Management" icon="code-branch">
    ```yaml
    versions:
      rollback: true
      keep_versions: 3
      beta_access: false
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

On-chain references can record which version of the desktop client was used to perform critical actions.
