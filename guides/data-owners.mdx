description: 'Learn how to securely manage and monetize your AI data assets on SUI with Walrus storage'
---

## Overview

As a data owner in the SUI ecosystem, you can securely store, reference, and monetize your AI-related data assets—such as datasets, model weights, or vector embeddings—by using Walrus for decentralized storage and SUI smart contracts for immutable reference and pricing logic. Off-chain workflows handle heavy lifting (like large-file uploads and dynamic pricing calculations), while SUI ensures trust, transparency, and verifiable transactions.

## Supported Asset Types

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  1. **Create Account**
     Set up your SUI wallet (e.g., via `sera-cli`) 
     - Obtain testnet or mainnet SUI tokens for transaction fees.

  2. **Upload Assets to Walrus**
     - Store large files (datasets, models) directly in Walrus
     - Retrieve a Content Identifier (CID) to reference on-chain

  3. **List Assets on SUI**
     - Use SUI transactions to register asset metadata, pricing, and terms
     - Buyers interact with your listings trustlessly on the blockchain
</Steps>

## Data Management
### Uploading Data to Walrus
Instead of uploading large datasets or model weights directly to the blockchain, you'll use Walrus. Walrus provides decentralized, redundant storage and returns a CID that you register on SUI:

```python
from sera.upload import WalrusUploader

# Initialize uploader for a dataset asset
uploader = WalrusUploader(
    asset_type="dataset",
    privacy_level="private",
    walrus_gateway="https://walrus-gateway.example.com"
)

# Upload with metadata off-chain, get CID
cid = uploader.upload(
    path="./my_dataset",
    metadata={
        "description": "Training dataset for NLP",
        "format": "parquet",
        "size": "10GB"
    }
)

# Once uploaded, store CID on SUI
tx_digest = uploader.register_on_sui(
    cid=cid,
    name="My_NLP_Training_Dataset",
    category="nlp"
)
print(f"Dataset registered on SUI: {tx_digest}")
```

### Organization Tools
Use off-chain tools to manage versions, categories, and metadata. When ready, you anchor references to these versions or categories on SUI so that buyers and partners can verify authenticity:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Asset Management" icon="folders">
    - • Maintain version histories off-chain
    - • Record version hashes and references on-chain
    - • Update categories and tags via SUI transactions
    - • Access control: record permission references on-chain, enforce off-chain
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality Control" icon="check-double">
    - • Run automated validation and formatting checks off-chain
    - • Store integrity checksums (hashes) on SUI for verifiability
    - • Quality scores computed off-chain, reference stored on-chain
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Monetization Options
### Pricing Models
Set initial prices on SUI and store logic references for more complex pricing models. For dynamic or auction-based pricing, computations occur off-chain (e.g., a separate pricing service) and periodically update references on SUI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fixed Price">
    - Set a stable price for your data asset
    - Offer bundle pricing by grouping multiple CIDs on one SUI contract
    - Volume discounts managed by off-chain logic, with updated references on-chain
    - Subscription terms recorded on-chain, validated off-chain
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Dynamic Pricing">
    - Auction processes run off-chain; final clearing price recorded on-chain
    - Demand-driven or time-limited offers: off-chain calculation updates on-chain reference regularly
    - Negotiations off-chain; once agreed, finalize price on SUI
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Revenue Streams

  <Card title="Direct Sales" icon="money-bill">
    - • One-time purchases, settled in SUI tokens

  </Card>
  <Card title="Licensing" icon="file-contract">
    - • Issue usage licenses anchored on-chain
    - • Recurring fees collected in stable SUI-based tokens
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Access" icon="code">
    - • Buyers pay per query off-chain

  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Solutions" icon="puzzle-piece">
    - • Tailored data packages negotiated off-chain
    - • Final terms and proofs recorded on SUI
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security & Compliance
### Data Protection

<Steps>
  1. **Encryption**
     Encrypt all data before uploading to Walrus. Store encryption keys securely off-chain.

  2. **Access Control**
     On-chain references define who can access what. Off-chain gateways enforce policies.

  3. **Audit Trails**
     Every transaction and update to asset references is recorded on SUI. Off-chain logs can be hashed and recorded on-chain.

  4. **Compliance**
     SUI-based attestation and verifiable credentials to show compliance with GDPR, CCPA, or other standards.
     Proof of compliance stored as on-chain metadata.
</Steps>

### Rights Management

  </Card>
  <Card title="Licensing" icon="file-contract">
    - • Leverage custom license agreements stored off-chain

</CardGroup>

## Analytics & Reporting
### Dashboard Features (Off-Chain)
An off-chain dashboard provides sales analytics, usage metrics, and other insights. Key aggregated metrics can be hashed and anchored to SUI for trust:

- Off-chain: Sales analytics, usage metrics, revenue tracking, market insights
- On-chain: Store hashed metrics for verification, finalizing monthly or quarterly reports with an immutable record on SUI
