## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Chrome Browser" icon="chrome">
    Latest version of Chrome required for our browser extension
  </Card>
  <Card title="SUI Wallet" icon="wallet">
    A SUI-compatible wallet (e.g., Sui Wallet or OKX Wallet) to manage $SERA tokens and sign on-chain transactions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  1. **Install Chrome Extension**
     Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) and install our SUI-based AI Extension. This extension will help you interact with and record AI contributions while referencing SUI on-chain data and Walrus storage.

  2. **Connect Wallet**
     After installation, click the extension icon and connect your chosen SUI-compatible wallet. This allows you to sign transactions and claim earned $SERA tokens on the SUI network.

  3. **Configure Settings**
     Set your privacy preferences and data sharing controls. You have full control over what metadata gets recorded on-chain versus stored off-chain in Walrus.

  4. **Start Contributing**
     Begin interacting with supported off-chain AI models. Your interactions, validated for quality and uniqueness, are automatically recorded and referenced on SUI. Periodically, you will receive $SERA token rewards according to your contribution quality and other factors.
</Steps>

## Maximizing Rewards

### Reward Formula Explained
Your rewards are calculated using a formula stored and verifiable on-chain:

$$
R = α · Q(c) · V(s) · e^{-λt} · (1 + ΣβᵢMᵢ)
$$

Where:
- $α$ (alpha): Base rate defined by on-chain parameters
- $Q(c)$: Quality score of your contribution, computed off-chain but anchored on-chain for transparency
- $V(s)$: Value score indicating how valuable your contribution is to the ecosystem
- $λt$: Time decay factor, encouraging timely and continuous contributions
- $βᵢMᵢ$: Model-specific multipliers tracked on-chain to incentivize interaction with certain models

<Note>
High-quality, unique interactions with AI models, as measured by off-chain audits and recorded on-chain, lead to significantly better $SERA rewards.
