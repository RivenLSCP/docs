## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Chrome Browser" icon="chrome">
    Latest version of Chrome required for our browser extension
  </Card>
  <Card title="SUI Wallet" icon="wallet">
    A SUI-compatible wallet (e.g., Sui Wallet or OKX Wallet) with sufficient SUI for gas fees
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  1. **Install Chrome Extension**
     Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) and install our extension. The extension facilitates interaction with SUI smart contracts and Walrus storage protocols.

  2. **Connect Wallet**
     Connect your SUI wallet to sign transactions. You'll need a small amount of SUI for gas fees when submitting contributions.

  3. **Configure Storage Settings**
     Your AI interactions are automatically processed:
     - Metadata and verification proofs stored on SUI blockchain
     - Interaction data stored in Walrus using Red Stuff encoding
     - All storage costs covered by the protocol
     - Data split into primary/secondary slivers per Walrus spec 

  4. **Start Contributing**
     Begin interacting with supported AI models:
     - Each interaction is processed in real-time
     - Data is automatically encoded and distributed
     - Earn $SERA tokens based on quality and volu
</Steps>

## Reward Mechanism

### Technical Implementation
Rewards are calculated using verifiable on-chain parameters:

$$
R = α · Q(c) · M(t) · V(i) · (1 + B)
$$

Where:
- $α$ (alpha): Base rate defined in smart contract
- $Q(c)$: Quality score (0.1 to 1.0)
- $M(t)$: Model tier multiplier (1.0x - 1.5x)
- $V(i)$: Volume multiplier (1.0x - 1.5x)
- $B$: Bonus multipliers (referrals, streaks)

<Note>
Rewards are processed in batches aligned with Walrus storage epochs (approximately every 24 hours) to optimize gas costs.

### Implementation Details
- Data is split and encoded using Walrus's Red Stuff protocol
- Primary and secondary slivers ensure data availability
- Metadata stored on SUI blockchain for verification
- Storage costs handled by protocol treasury
