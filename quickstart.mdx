## Installation

### Browser Extension

1. **Access the Chrome Web Store**: Navigate to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore).
2. **Search for Our AI-To-Earn Extension**: Enter "Sera AI-To-Earn" in the search bar.
3. **Add Extension**: Click on "Add to Chrome" to install the extension.

## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="wallet" title="Connect Your Wallet">
    To receive $SERA rewards and participate in the decentralized marketplace, connect your SUI-compatible crypto wallet. Supported wallets include:
    - **Sui Wallet**
    - **OKX Wallet**
    - **Other SUI-compatible wallets (via WalletConnect)**

    By connecting your wallet, you'll be able to store and manage $SERA tokens, sign transactions, and reference on-chain data assets.

   <Accordion icon="message" title="Start Contributing Data">
    1. **Engage with Supported AI Models**: Open AI platforms integrated with our system. Begin meaningful, diverse, and high-quality conversations.
    2. **Automatic On-Chain Tracking**: The extension monitors your eligible AI interactions off-chain, then securely records a proof of contribution on the SUI blockchain.
    3. **Earn Points Before Conversion**: As you contribute, you accumulate quality and value scores off-chain. These are periodically committed on-chain to convert into $SERA tokens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="coins" title="Earn Rewards">
    Rewards are calculated using the formula:

    $$
R = \alpha \cdot Q(c) \cdot V(s) \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \cdot \biggl(1 + \sum \beta_i M_i\biggr)
$$

Where:
- $Q(c)$: **Quality Score** (assessed off-chain, anchored on-chain)
- $V(s)$: **Value Score** (uniqueness & significance logged on-chain)
- $M$: **Model-specific multipliers** (1.0–2.0x, stored on-chain for transparency)
- $α, \lambda, \beta_i$: Parameters defined and governed by on-chain contracts

Additional bonuses are available through referral programs and quest systems, with all incentives and completions verifiable on the SUI blockchain.
