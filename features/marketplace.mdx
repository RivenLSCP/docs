## Overview

Our AI Data Marketplace is a decentralized platform for trading AI data assets, such as datasets, models, vector databases, and pipelines. The marketplace leverages the SUI blockchain for immutable, on-chain records of ownership, pricing, and royalties. All large data is stored off-chain in Walrus, providing high throughput and cost-effective storage, while SUI handles the trust and governance layer. Buyers and sellers interact with the marketplace through smart contracts, ensuring a trustless and permissionless environment.

## Performance Metrics

Because of the off-chain Walrus storage and decentralized infrastructure, data retrieval and processing are extremely fast compared to traditional cloud-based approaches.

### Processing Speed Comparison

| Data Size | Traditional | Sera    | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 10GB      | 900s       | 5-10s   | ~180x       |
| 30GB      | 2700s      | 5-10s   | ~450x       |
| 100GB     | 9000s      | 5-10s   | ~1800x      |

Improvements come from Walrus’s distributed storage, efficient caching, and transparent on-chain references ensuring trust without heavy overhead.

## Getting Started

### For Sellers

<Steps>
  1. **Prepare Your Data**
     Package your AI assets according to marketplace standards. Upload to Walrus for secure, decentralized storage. Anchor a CID on SUI.

  2. **Set Pricing**
     Choose between fixed price or auction formats. Both pricing models are controlled via on-chain smart contracts.

  3. **List Asset**
     Deploy a listing contract on SUI. Set royalty parameters, attach proofs of quality or accuracy, and ensure all metadata (like model framework, dataset schema) is stored as immutable references on-chain.

  4. **Monitor Sales**
     Track on-chain transactions and manage listings through smart contract interactions. Adjust pricing or availability as needed.
</Steps>

### For Buyers

<Steps>
  1. **Browse Assets**
     Use on-chain indexes and filters to search for desired datasets, models, or pipelines. Metadata and versioning info are stored on SUI.

  2. **Verify Quality**
     Check attestations, ratings, and on-chain history. ZK proofs or off-chain signatures verified on-chain ensure authenticity and performance claims.

  3. **Purchase**
     Complete the transaction with $SERA tokens or other supported SUI-based tokens. On-chain settlement ensures transparent and instantaneous ownership transfer.

  4. **Download & Integrate**
     Retrieve your purchased assets from Walrus using the on-chain referenced CID. Integrate them into your workflow confidently, knowing the lineage and authenticity are guaranteed on-chain.
</Steps>

## Integration Options

Below is an example showing how to list an asset programmatically. The on-chain marketplace and wallet interactions ensure trust and a frictionless user experience. Off-chain data handling via Walrus is referenced through CIDs:

```python
from sera import Marketplace
from sera.wallet import SuiWallet

# Initialize marketplace client
wallet = SuiWallet.connect()
market = Marketplace.connect(wallet)

# List an asset
market.list_asset(
    asset_path="./my_model",
    asset_type="model",
    price=1000,  # In $SERA tokens
    royalty_percentage=2.5,
    metadata={
        "framework": "pytorch",
        "accuracy": 0.95,
        "training_data": "description",
        "verification_proof": "0x..."  # ZK proof hash
    }
)
```
