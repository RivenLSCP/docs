description: 'Built on Walrus storage protocol and SUI blockchain for secure, verifiable AI data management'
---

## Overview

Our infrastructure combines SUI blockchain's security and programmability with Walrus protocol's efficient decentralized storage to create a reliable foundation for AI data operations. SUI handles governance, access control, and payment logic, while Walrus provides high-performance content-addressed storage optimized for AI datasets and models.

## Storage System

### Walrus Integration

```python
from sera.storage import WalrusClient

# Initialize Walrus client
storage = WalrusClient(
    gateway="https://gateway.sera.network",
    sui_package_id="0x..."  # Our deployed package
)

# Store data with 2-year retention
cid = storage.store(
    data_path="./dataset.zip",
    retention_epochs=52,  # 1 epoch = 2 weeks
    encryption=True
)

# Retrieve data
storage.retrieve(
    cid=cid,
    destination="./retrieved_data"
)
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Theoretical Maximum | Practical Considerations |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Write     | ~20% of network capacity | • 4x-5x bandwidth overhead due to erasure coding |
|           |                   | • Must distribute to all storage nodes |
|           |                   | • Limited by Red Stuff encoding speed |
| Read      | ~100% of network capacity | • Requires downloading from f+1 nodes |
|           |                   | • Limited by node proximity and network conditions |
|           |                   | • Actual size comparable to original blob |

<Note>
Performance scales with network size:
- Each storage node adds to aggregate capacity
- Geographic distribution improves latency
- Sharding by blob_id enables infinite scaling
- Reads can be optimized by choosing nearby nodes
</Note>

    sui_token="your_token_here"
)

# Create collection with on-chain tracking

    name="chat_embeddings",
    dimension=768,
    metadata={
        "description": "Chat history embeddings",
        "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
    }

# Add vectors with SUI-tracked metadata
collection.add(
    vectors=embeddings,
    metadata={
        "conversation_id": "0x123...",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-15T10:30:00Z"
    }

# Query with access verification
results = collection.query(
    vector=query_vector,
    top_k=10,
    filter={"conversation_id": "0x123..."}
)

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

<Steps>
  1. **Encryption**
     - Client-side encryption before upload to Walrus
     - AES-256-GCM for data encryption
     - Key management through SUI smart contracts
     - Encrypted data chunks stored on Walrus nodes

  2. **Access Control**
     - SUI Move-based access control logic
     - Role-based permissions stored on-chain
     - Granular data access policies
     - Time-based access expiration

  3. **Audit Logging**
     - Critical operations logged on SUI blockchain
     - Access attempts tracked via events
     - Immutable audit trail for compliance
     - Metadata hashes stored on-chain

  4. **Compliance**
     - GDPR compliance through data encryption
     - Data deletion via key revocation
     - Selective disclosure controls
     - Geographic data restrictions via smart contracts
</Steps>

### Network Security

```python
# Example of secure data upload with encryption
from sera.security import DataEncryption

# Initialize encryption with SUI-managed keys
encryption = DataEncryption(
    sui_client="https://fullnode.sera.network",
    package_id="0x..."
)

# Encrypt data before upload
encrypted_data = encryption.encrypt_file(
    file_path="./sensitive_data.zip",
    access_policy={
        "allowed_addresses": ["0x123...", "0x456..."],
        "expiry": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    }
)

# Store encrypted data on Walrus
cid = storage.store(
    data=encrypted_data,
    retention_epochs=52
)

# Record access policy on SUI
encryption.register_access_policy(
    cid=cid,
    policy_id="0x..."
)
```

## Monitoring & Management

### System Metrics

```python
from sera.monitoring import MetricsCollector

# Initialize metrics collector
metrics = MetricsCollector(
    sui_client="https://fullnode.sera.network",
    walrus_gateway="https://gateway.sera.network"

# Record storage metrics
metrics.record_storage_metrics({
    "total_stored_bytes": 1024 * 1024 * 1024,  # 1GB
    "active_files": 150,
    "bandwidth_usage": 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB
