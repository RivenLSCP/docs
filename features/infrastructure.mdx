description: 'Built on decentralized storage (Walrus) and off-chain compute power governed by SUI'
---

## Overview

Our decentralized infrastructure leverages the SUI blockchain for trust and governance, Walrus protocol for secure, content-addressed storage, and a decentralized compute network for scalable, reliable compute resources. This combination creates a robust, high-performance foundation for AI operations where on-chain logic ensures transparency and verifiability, while off-chain resources deliver the raw power and speed.

## Storage System

### Walrus Integration

Walrus acts as the off-chain decentralized storage layer. SUI stores the metadata, references (CIDs), and policies. You use the Walrus client locally to store/retrieve data, while SUI ensures immutability and audit trails.

```python
from sera.storage import WalrusClient

# Initialize Walrus storage client
storage = WalrusClient(
    gateway="https://walrus-gateway.example.com",
    sui_package_id="0x...package_id"
)

# Store data (off-chain), record CID on SUI
cid = storage.store(
    data_path="./my_dataset",
    redundancy=3,
    encryption=True
)

# Retrieve data from Walrus
storage.retrieve(
    cid=cid,
    destination="./retrieved_data"
)
```

### Performance Metrics

| Operation | Traditional Cloud | Sera Storage | Improvement |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Upload    | ~120 MB/s        | ~850 MB/s     | ~7x faster    |
| Download  | ~100 MB/s        | ~920 MB/s     | ~9x faster    |
| Latency   | ~150ms           | ~20ms         | ~7.5x lower  |

These improvements stem from Walrus’s decentralized architecture and distributed caching. On-chain references ensure authenticity of these metrics.

## Compute Network

### Resource Types

Off-chain compute resources (GPU/CPU) are sourced from decentralized providers. SUI tracks resource agreements and proofs of workload completion.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GPU Resources">
    - • High-end GPUs (A100, V100) for large-scale training
    - • Mid-range GPUs (T4, P100) for inference workloads
    - • Commodity GPUs (RTX series) for cost-effective tasks
    - • Allocation policies recorded on-chain, enforcement off-chain
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CPU Resources">
    - • High-performance CPU instances for complex preprocessing
    - • Memory-optimized nodes for large in-memory datasets
    - • General-purpose compute nodes for flexible tasks 
    - • Automatic scaling rules anchored on-chain

## Vector Database

### Features

Off-chain vector databases (like ChromaDB) handle vector storage and queries. The SUI chain records collection configuration, index parameters, and versioning for verifiability.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Indexing" icon="magnifying-glass">
    - • Multiple index types (HNSW, IVF, etc.) defined off-chain
    - • Auto-optimization guided by usage, with final configs logged on-chain
    - • Real-time updates triggered off-chain, anchored on-chain
  </Card>
  <Card title="Querying" icon="database">
    - • Similarity search off-chain
    - • Hybrid and filtered queries using on-chain metadata references
    - • Verified indexing parameters stored on-chain
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scaling" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">
    - • Horizontal scaling off-chain with references updated on-chain
    - • Automatic sharding and load balancing managed by off-chain controllers
    - • SUI stores immutable pointers to cluster states
  </Card>
  <Card title="Management" icon="sliders">
    - • Monitoring and metrics off-chain, integrity proofs on-chain
    - • Backup/Restore with CIDs recorded on-chain
    - • Version control ensures that any change in config or data is trackable on SUI
  </Card>

### Usage Example

```python
from sera.vector import VectorDB

# Initialize vector database
db = VectorDB.connect(cluster="main")

# Create collection
collection = db.create_collection(
    name="embeddings",
    dimension=768
)

# Add vectors
collection.add(
    vectors=embeddings,
    metadata=metadata
)

# Query
results = collection.query(
    vector=query_vector,
    top_k=10
)
```

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

<Steps>
  1. **Encryption**
     All data encrypted at rest off-chain, keys managed securely. On-chain records show key rotation events.

  2. **Access Control**
     Fine-grained permissions stored on-chain (role-based access), enforced off-chain by gateways.

  3. **Audit Logging**
     Comprehensive activity logs off-chain, hashed and anchored on-chain for non-repudiation.

  4. **Compliance**
     GDPR, CCPA considerations integrated with selective disclosure on-chain and privacy-preserving proofs off-chain.
</Steps>

### Network Security

- DDoS protection through off-chain gateways, on-chain references to security policies.
- Node validation ensures only trusted participants join the network.
- Secure TLS channels for data transport.
- Regular security audits published on-chain as cryptographic attestations.

## Monitoring & Management

### Dashboard Features

<Frame>

</Frame>

- Off-chain resource utilization metrics (CPU, GPU, memory usage) aggregated and periodically hashed for on-chain reference.
- Network health monitoring with on-chain stable references to threshold rules.
- Cost tracking off-chain, final monthly summaries recorded on-chain.
- Performance analytics with historical data hashed and anchored on SUI.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  1. **Create Account**
     Register your SUI address and acquire necessary permissions on-chain.
  2. **Choose Resources**
     Specify desired storage (Walrus) and compute resources off-chain, record your selections on-chain
  3. **Configure Network**
     On-chain references define your network preferences. Off-chain orchestrators then provision your setup.
  4. **Deploy**
     Start using the infrastructure by uploading datasets, indexing embeddings, and running training jobs. All references and critical actions are recorded on SUI for trust and auditability.
