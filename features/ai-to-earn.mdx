description: "Monetize your AI interactions in a trustless environment on SUI"
---

**AI-To-Earn** revolutionizes data contribution by letting you monetize your interactions with AI models while helping advance artificial intelligence research. Natively built on the SUI blockchain, the protocol transforms your AI interactions into verifiable contributions recorded on-chain. You earn $SERA tokens, a SUI-native token, for high-quality conversations and valuable data, creating a decentralized ecosystem that rewards meaningful engagement.


## How It Works

<Steps>
  1. **Connect Wallet**  
     Connect your SUI-compatible wallet (e.g., Sui Wallet, OKX Wallet). This wallet manages your $SERA tokens and signs your interactions.

  2. **Start Contributing**  
     Interact with supported off-chain AI models. Every contribution (conversation, input, feedback) is hashed and anchored on SUI, ensuring authenticity and verifiability.

  3. **Earn SERA**  
     Your contributions are scored off-chain for quality and uniqueness. Smart contracts on SUI calculate your rewards and distribute $SERA tokens accordingly.

  4. **Boost Earnings**  
     Stake $SERA tokens to increase your reward multiplier. On-chain staking contracts grant governance rights and unlock premium model access.
</Steps>

## Reward Formula

Contributions are evaluated off-chain, and results are recorded on-chain to ensure fairness and immutability:
  $$
  R = \alpha \cdot Q(c) \cdot V(s) \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \cdot \left(1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \beta_i M_i\right)
  $$

Where:

- $α$: On-chain base rate
- $Q(c)$: Quality Score (based on engagement and consistency, computed off-chain, anchored on-chain)
- $V(s)$: Value Score (uniqueness & significance, computed off-chain, validated on-chain)
- $λt$: Time decay factor defined on-chain to encourage continual contributions
- $βᵢMᵢ$: Model-specific multipliers recorded on-chain, incentivizing interactions with certain models


#### Quality Score $Q(c)$

$$
Q(c) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(q - q_0)}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2 + \sigma_0^2}}
$$

- This measures conversation quality. Engagement metrics and consistency checks are done off-chain, with summaries hashed and referenced on-chain.

#### Value Score $V(s)$

$$
V(s) = \log(1 + \frac{s}{s_0}) \cdot (1 + \gamma \cdot \text{unique}(s))
$$

- Value is determined by uniqueness and significance, ensuring that more original and impactful contributions are rewarded more. All computations happen off-chain, with final scores committed on-chain for auditability.

## Model-Specific Multipliers

The SUI blockchain stores multipliers for different model tiers, guiding the incentive structure:
